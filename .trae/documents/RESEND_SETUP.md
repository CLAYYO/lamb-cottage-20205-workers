## 1. Prerequisites

- Domain name (optional - can use Resend's domain)
- Access to DNS management (if using custom domain)
- Pages CMS project ready for deployment

## 2. Create Resend Account

### 2.1 Sign Up
1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Click **Sign Up**
3. Enter your email address and create a password
4. Verify your email address
5. Complete the onboarding process

### 2.2 Account Verification

   - **Pro tier**: $20/month for 50,000 emails/month

## 3. Domain Configuration

### Option A: Use Resend Domain (Easiest)
Resend provides a default sending domain that works immediately:
- **From address**: `noreply@resend.dev`
- **No DNS setup required**
- **Good for testing and development**

### Option B: Custom Domain (Recommended for Production)

#### 3.1 Add Your Domain
1. In Resend dashboard, go to **Domains**
2. Click **Add Domain**
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `lambcottage.com`)
4. Click **Add Domain**

#### 3.2 DNS Configuration
Add the following DNS records to your domain:

**SPF Record (TXT)**
```
Name: @
Value: v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all
```

**DKIM Records (CNAME)**
```
Name: resend._domainkey
Value: resend._domainkey.resend.com

Name: resend2._domainkey
Value: resend2._domainkey.resend.com
```

**DMARC Record (TXT) - Optional but Recommended**
```
Name: _dmarc
Value: v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com
```

#### 3.3 Verify Domain
1. After adding DNS records, wait 5-10 minutes
2. In Resend dashboard, click **Verify** next to your domain
3. Check that all records show as verified
4. Domain status should change to **Verified**

## 4. Generate API Key

### 4.1 Create API Key
1. In Resend dashboard, go to **API Keys**
2. Click **Create API Key**
3. Configure the key:
   - **Name**: `Pages CMS Production` (or appropriate name)
   - **Permission**: **Full access** (or **Sending access** for production)
   - **Domain**: Select your verified domain (or leave blank for resend.dev)
4. Click **Add**
5. **Important**: Copy the API key immediately - it won't be shown again

### 4.2 Store API Key Securely
```env
# Save this for Pages CMS environment variables
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxx_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## 5. Email Templates Configuration

### 5.1 Authentication Email Template
Pages CMS uses these email types:
- **Magic Link Login**: For passwordless authentication
- **Password Reset**: For password recovery
- **Email Verification**: For new account verification
- **Invitation**: For team member invitations

### 5.2 Configure From Address
Choose your from address based on domain setup:

**Using Resend Domain:**
```env
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@resend.dev
FROM_NAME=Lamb Cottage CMS
```

**Using Custom Domain:**
```env
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@lambcottage.com
FROM_NAME=Lamb Cottage CMS
```

  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "from": "noreply@yourdomain.com",
    "to": ["test@example.com"],

    "html": "<p>This is a test email from Resend!</p>"
  }'
```

### 7.2 Test Through Pages CMS

2. Monitor email delivery status
3. Check for any bounces or delivery failures
4. Review email content and formatting

## 8. Production Optimization

### 8.1 Email Deliverability Best Practices

**Domain Reputation:**

- Gradually increase sending volume
- Monitor bounce rates and spam complaints

**Content Optimization:**
- Use clear, descriptive subject lines
- Include both HTML and plain text versions
- Avoid spam trigger words

   - Delivery failures
   - Bounces
   - Spam complaints
3. Point webhooks to your monitoring system

## 9. Troubleshooting

### 9.1 Common Issues

**Emails Not Sending:**
- Verify API key is correct and has proper permissions

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     https://api.resend.com/domains
```

# Check SPF record
dig TXT yourdomain.com | grep spf

# Check DKIM records
dig CNAME resend._domainkey.yourdomain.com
